# Learning Linux

The excellent course [Mastering Linux](https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-linux/)
by *Jannis Seemann* helped me acquire essential Linux skills. This documentation is a summary of what I learned
from that course. The order of topics is almost exactly the same as the order of topics in the course.
I use this documentation also as reference material. This summary leans very heavily on the slides of the mentioned course.
Hence, all credits go to Jannis Seemann for offering his course and the accompanying slides.

*I highly recommend the Linux course by Jannis Seemann to everyone who works with Linux*. That would also
include almost everyone working with Docker containers and/or Kubernetes.

The ultimate "bash reference document" is the [Bash Reference Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/).

Following the structure of the course, this documentation contains the following parts:
1. [Part 1. Installation](./part-1-installation.md)
2. [Part 2. The Bash CLI](./part-2-bash-cli.md)
3. [Part 3. Linux Core Concepts](./part-3-linux-core-concepts.md)
4. [Part 4. Bash Scripting](./part-4-bash-scripting.md)
