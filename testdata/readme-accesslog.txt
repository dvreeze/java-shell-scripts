The sample access log file (access.log) originates from the Udemy course
"Mastering Linux: The Comprehensive Guide", by Jannis Seemann.
All credits go to him.

A slightly modified copy of the access.log file seems to better obey the
Combined Log Format, by enclosing the date-time field in square bracket pairs.
That also corresponds with the regex found on the internet for this log format.

Another access log file (another-access.log) came from
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/examples/master/Common%20Data%20Formats/apache_logs/apache_logs.
